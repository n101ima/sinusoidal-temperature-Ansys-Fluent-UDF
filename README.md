# sinusoidal-temperature-Ansys-Fluent-UDF
This UDF defines a function that assigns a sinusoidal temperature profile to a face zone in Fluent. The UDF uses the following parameters and variables:

•  sinusoidaltemp: the name of the user-defined function that takes three arguments: thread, n, and f.

•  thread: a pointer to the thread structure of the face zone where the temperature profile is applied.

•  n: an index that represents the variable ID of the temperature.

•  f: a variable that represents a face in the face loop.

•  yy[ND_ND]: an array that stores the coordinates of the face centroid.

•  l: a scalar that represents the length of the domain in the x-direction. It has units of m.

•  b: a scalar that represents the dimensionless length of the face centroid in the x-direction. It is given by $$b = \frac{x}{l}$$ where $x$ is the x-coordinate of the face centroid, and $l$ is the length of the domain.

•  pi: a scalar that represents the mathematical constant pi. It has an approximate value of 3.1415.

•  F_CENTROID: a macro that returns the coordinates of the face centroid and stores them in yy.

•  F_PROFILE: a macro that sets the value of the temperature at the face f and thread thread to 300 + sin(2pib).

The UDF performs the following steps:


It defines some constants and variables for the simulation.
It begins a face loop over the face zone where the temperature profile is applied.
It calculates the coordinates of the face centroid using F_CENTROID and stores them in yy.
It calculates the dimensionless length of the face centroid in the x-direction using yy[0] and l and stores it in b.
It calculates the sinusoidal temperature at the face f using F_PROFILE and sets it to 300 + sin(2pib).
It ends the face loop.

The UDF can be used to model heat transfer problems with periodic boundary conditions, such as heat exchangers, oscillating heat pipes, or solar collectors. The UDF also demonstrates how to use macros, arrays, and mathematical functions in Fluent UDFs.
